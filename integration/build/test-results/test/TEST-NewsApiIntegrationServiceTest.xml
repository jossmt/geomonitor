They won the title with a defeat, their first in a year, five months and 16 days. Their last loss was to Australia at Twickenham in October 2015. So it was an unfamiliar feeling and, judging by they way they looked and the words they spoke, the players did not find it had improved too much in the time since they last experienced it. For a chunk of the team it was a new sensation. Maro Itoje, Ben Te’o, Elliot Daly, Kyle Sinckler and Nathan Hughes have won 44 caps between them but this was still the first time they had lost an international match.</p><p>One had to wonder how Eddie Jones was going to spin it.

In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/mar/21/features11.g2">Anthony Neilson</a>’s 1991 play, Wehner is the naive young lawyer appointed to defend Peter Kürten (Richard Ede), <a href="http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/peter-kurten-the-vampire-of-dusseldorf">a real-life serial killer</a> who committed nine murders in 1929 in Düsseldorf. Wehner initially thinks his task is straightforward – “I didn’t have to prove him innocent, just insane” – but soon discovers that Kürten refuses to countenance such a get out, and he is the one who needs to question his normality and perhaps understand his true nature.</p><p>In Grace Smart’s clever design, a forest of scissors hangs from the ceiling, glinting menacingly (Kürten committed some of his murders with scissors). Emma Baggott’s astute revival, meanwhile, plays much of the action across a metal table that conjures both abattoir and morgue. Baggott recognises the expressionist influence on this play – there is a neatly played jerky silent movie scene. She also draws fine performances from all three actors, including Cathy Walker as Peter’s wife who, like Wehner, becomes a puppet in the hands of a man who is disconcertingly portrayed as the most charismatic character on stage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/19/normal-review-styx-london">Continue reading...</a>nullhttps://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/19/normal-review-styx-londonnull, ‘We’re cheated, first in India, then in Qatar’: how World Cup workers are deceivednull<p>In India and Nepal, agents and middlemen charge up to £1,000 in illegal fees to recruit workers for World Cup 2022</p><p>A group of young men jump to attention as Vishnukanth Thapar nonchalantly sweeps past to open the front door of the Career Wings travel agency.

A mishmash of new age mysticism and low church gloom, the pseudo-religion flourished amid the bereavement of the first world war and its aftermath; Conan Doyle had lost his adored son Kingsley to the flu epidemic of 1918. Had he dabbled seriously in mediums and moonshine before <em>The Hound of the Baskervilles</em> appeared in 1902, the fire-breathing beast of Grimpen Mire might really have come from the beyond, as we are led at first to believe. Instead, the novel is enlivened by marvellous corny humour. “I have ample evidence,” Holmes tells his client Sir Henry Baskerville, “that you are being dogged in London.”</p><p>Complete with pipe, Stradivarius and magnifying glass (though not deerstalker: the hat was added by the <em>Strand</em> magazine illustrator Sidney Paget), Sherlock Holmes was hooked on cocaine and injected himself with morphine in order to stave off fears of boredom. The detective’s darker side, made explicit in the drug–taking of the second Holmes novel, <em>The Sign of Four</em> (1890), contradicts the cosy deerstalker image. Conan Doyle himself was familiar with stimulants from his medical studies at Edinburgh University in the early 1880s, and later witnessed varieties of addiction (notably to rum) as a trainee surgeon aboard a whaling ship. His relationship with Sherlock was fraught with dark undercurrents and possibilities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/19/arthur-and-sherlock-michael-sims-diligent-study-conan-doyle-holmes">Continue reading...</a>nullhttps://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/19/arthur-and-sherlock-michael-sims-diligent-study-conan-doyle-holmesnull, The biggest financial risk for women today?

The narrator is a translator in a foreign country searching for her former husband and the starting point for the book was whether there’s such a thing as total transparency between two people. I think more often than not, there is some kind of persistent unknowability, even in somebody you’re very close to. And I suppose there’s an unknowability in ourselves. I’m always interested in a character who does something and doesn’t understand why they’ve done&nbsp;it. So in this book, it’s the narrator’s decision to keep her promise to her husband not to tell anyone they’ve separated.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/19/katie-kitamura-meet-the-author-a-separation-fiction-hannah-beckerman">Continue reading...</a>nullhttps://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/19/katie-kitamura-meet-the-author-a-separation-fiction-hannah-beckermannull, German PoW and hero goalie stars in tale of reconciliationnullFilm tells how Bert Trautmann, who played in Cup final with broken neck, overcame Nazi past<p>As a piece of fiction, a film about a former Nazi paratrooper who becomes a hero of English football might struggle to convince audiences.

Then, just over a decade later, the king exploited the breach in Rome’s defences that Luther had created to launch a national church.</p><p>But Henry was always keen to stress that he was no Lutheran, and the German reformer’s new take on Christianity did not survive intact when crossing the Channel.

The project features Lionel Richie hits embroidered on to discarded furniture in a fitting cheese-coloured yarn. “I have a thing for old furniture,” Evans Fox says. “I think the textiles in our homes somehow retain the residue of our daily habits in their threads.” The series began when she surprised a neighbour by embroidering “Hello?” and “is it me you’re looking for?” on the couch they had left outside.

Baggott recognises the expressionist influence on this play – there is a neatly played jerky silent movie scene. She also draws fine performances from all three actors, including Cathy Walker as Peter’s wife who, like Wehner, becomes a puppet in the hands of a man who is disconcertingly portrayed as the most charismatic character on stage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/19/normal-review-styx-london">Continue reading...</a>nullhttps://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/19/normal-review-styx-londonnull

A mishmash of new age mysticism and low church gloom, the pseudo-religion flourished amid the bereavement of the first world war and its aftermath; Conan Doyle had lost his adored son Kingsley to the flu epidemic of 1918. Had he dabbled seriously in mediums and moonshine before <em>The Hound of the Baskervilles</em> appeared in 1902, the fire-breathing beast of Grimpen Mire might really have come from the beyond, as we are led at first to believe. Instead, the novel is enlivened by marvellous corny humour. “I have ample evidence,” Holmes tells his client Sir Henry Baskerville, “that you are being dogged in London.”</p><p>Complete with pipe, Stradivarius and magnifying glass (though not deerstalker: the hat was added by the <em>Strand</em> magazine illustrator Sidney Paget), Sherlock Holmes was hooked on cocaine and injected himself with morphine in order to stave off fears of boredom. The detective’s darker side, made explicit in the drug–taking of the second Holmes novel, <em>The Sign of Four</em> (1890), contradicts the cosy deerstalker image. Conan Doyle himself was familiar with stimulants from his medical studies at Edinburgh University in the early 1880s, and later witnessed varieties of addiction (notably to rum) as a trainee surgeon aboard a whaling ship. His relationship with Sherlock was fraught with dark undercurrents and possibilities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/19/arthur-and-sherlock-michael-sims-diligent-study-conan-doyle-holmes">Continue reading...</a>nullhttps://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/19/arthur-and-sherlock-michael-sims-diligent-study-conan-doyle-holmesnull
